# Analysis of 911 Call Data - Python Project

This Python project focuses on analyzing 911 call data sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset provides valuable insights into emergency calls received by the emergency services. The analysis is performed using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Analyze and explore the 911 call data to gain insights into emergency service patterns.
- Identify the top 5 zip codes with the highest number of emergency calls.
- Determine the top 5 towns with the highest number of emergency calls.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to present key findings effectively.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were utilized in this project:
- Python: A powerful programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
- NumPy: A fundamental library for scientific computing with Python.
- pandas: A versatile data analysis library providing data structures and analysis tools.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing enhanced aesthetics and additional plotting functions.

## Steps Involved
The project includes the following steps:
1. Data Acquisition: Obtaining the 911 call data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducting an in-depth analysis of the dataset.
4. Top 5 Zip Codes by Call: Identifying the zip codes with the highest number of emergency calls.
5. Top 5 Towns by Call: Determining the towns with the highest number of emergency calls.
6. Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations to communicate key insights effectively.
